## Introduction
A full-stack social media application. With email and Google Authentication, pagination, search and filtering capabilities, comments, and much more, this app is a fully responsive MERN social media application. 

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB, I build a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
